Legaspi, assistant director of the Export Marketing Bureau (EMB), said that more than ever, European consumers are buying into the organic trend, noting that&nbsp; half of European consumers think organic is healthier.<\/p>\n<p>The executive shared that 56 percent of French consumers buy organic food and drink products. In Spain, the percentage is 54 percent, in Poland 53 percent, Italy 49 percent, and Germany 45 percent.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOrganic food and drink products enjoy a perceived health halo among European consumers due to their clean label profiles,\u201d Legaspi explained during a recent presentation on exporting to Europe.<\/p>\n<p>To highlight the strong growth of the organic food market in Europe, she said that in 2015, about 19 percent of consumers in France were buying organic food products, but by 2017 this figure had jumped to 25 percent.<\/p>\n<p>Comparatively, 18 percent of German consumers bought organic in 2015, and 25 percent of them in 2017. Italy\u2019s figures were 18 percent in 2015, and 27 percent in 2017, while Spain registered 12 percent and 23 percent and Poland 14 percent and 20 percent, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Legaspi said the world consumer market for organic food products broke $100 billion in 2018 with Europe and North America representing more than 90 percent of the market.<\/p>\n<p>The best-selling products are dairy and eggs. According to the European Commission in a market brief published in 2019, the EU is the second-largest consumer of organic food in the world, with \u20ac34.3 billion in retail sales in 2017 for a 37-percent global market share, behind the US with 47 percent.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOver the last 10 years, the EU market doubled its size, and it continues growing at a significant pace [11 percent in 2017 compared to 2016], indicating that it has not yet reached its maturity stage,\u201d the brief read.<\/p>\n<p>Health concerns are the main driver for organic consumption, it continued. Environmental benefits of organic production and the growing concern over the effects on health of excessive exposure to pesticides and overuse of antibiotics are contributing to building a positive consumer attitude toward more natural alternatives.<\/p>\n<p>The largest EU markets for organic food products currently are Germany and France, while demand in Denmark and Sweden is expanding substantially, it added. The EU report further stated that organic eggs dominate organic retail sales, and that \u201cthe growth remains high.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Organic fresh fruit and vegetables represent another success story, and have a sustained growth rate in Europe, while consumption of organic dairy, including organic drinking milk is also significant.<\/p>\n<p>Conventional stores and supermarkets represent the main distribution channel for organic food products, accounting for about 75 percent, while specialized channels also carry these products, according to the market report.<\/p>\n<p>Legaspi urged Filipino exporters to avail themselves of the benefits under the EU Generalised System of Preferences+ (GSP+) when shipping to Europe. For the Philippines, the GSP+ means that over 6,000 categories of goods are eligible for export to the EU without tariffs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>17 February 2020 Published also in Business Mirror The appeal of organic foods continues to grow in Europe, presenting big opportunities for companies that can support this fast-rising consumer need, according to an export marketing official.

Lopez revealed this week.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe relatively strong export performance of the Philippines transpired amid DTI\u2019s [Department of Trade and Industry] strong efforts in attracting investments, spurring MSME [micro, small and medium enterprises] development, and promoting the ease of doing business,\u201d the trade chief said.<\/p>\n<p>Growing at 1.5 percent year-to-date, the country\u2019s export growth is also the second-best performer among East Asian economies, next to Vietnam. The Philippines, China and Vietnam were the only three countries that reported positive export performance among 11 trade-oriented Asian economies last year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur goal was to expand the productive capacity and export base, as well as in actively enhancing trade relations with existing partner economies, by marketing products abroad and exploring new export markets,\u201d Lopez said.<\/p>\n<p>For the first time, electronics exports hit $40 billion with a 4.4-percent year-to-date growth. The sector comprised of 56.9 percent of total exports, with non-electronic products the remaining 43.1 percent at $30.3 billion. For non-electronic products, top growers are: mineral products; fruits and vegetables; and travel goods and handbags.<\/p>\n<p>The top 4 destinations for Philippine merchandise items last year were the United States, Japan, China and Hong Kong. Lopez said that curbing inflation via aggressive price monitoring activities has also contributed in making locally-made products attractive to the global market.<\/p>\n<p>In December 2019, the Philippines was also the top performer with a 21.4-percent year-on-year growth, the fastest pace in 2019. This was largely on the back of a 24.9- percent year-on-year jump in electronic exports, which accounted for 60 percent of merchandise exports in December.

By accelerating the 7Ms strategy for MSME development, I am confident that our economic priority agenda to achieve inclusive growth and shared prosperity for all will bring into sharper focus the areas of higher importance and greater impact for our MSMEs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The summit was graced by Madam Honeylet Avance\u00f1a who reiterated the Duterte administration\u2019s full support to MSMEs and commitment to further advance entrepreneurship in the country, especially in the countryside.<\/p>\n<p>Attended by more than 1,000 participants from the ranks of entrepreneurs, tech startups, academe, business experts, mentors, and enablers, the Summit provided immense opportunities to exchange knowledge and insights from starting a business to preparing for the challenges ahead in today\u2019s globally competitive business environment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>29 July 2019 Published also in Business Mirror The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), as chairman of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Development Council (MSMEDC), staged this year\u2019s National MSME Summit on July 16, 2019, at the Philippine International Convention Center (PICC), Pasay City, to showcase vital and game-changing whole-of-government policy reforms, programs,<a class=\"moretag\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dti.gov.ph\/negosyo\/exports\/emb-news\/lopez-highlights-push-for-smarter-msmes\/\"> continue reading : Lopez highlights push for \u2018smarter\u2019 MSMEs <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":24,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_EventAllDay":false,"_EventTimezone":"","_EventStartDate":"","_EventEndDate":"","_EventStartDateUTC":"","_EventEndDateUTC":"","_EventShowMap":false,"_EventShowMapLink":false,"_EventURL":"","_EventCost":"","_EventCostDescription":"","_EventCurrencySymbol":"","_EventCurrencyPosition":"","_EventDateTimeSeparator":"","_EventTimeRangeSeparator":"","_EventOrganizerID":[],"_EventVenueID":0,"_OrganizerEmail":"","_OrganizerPhone":"","_OrganizerWebsite":"","_VenueAddress":"","_VenueCity":"","_VenueCountry":"","_VenueProvince":"","_VenueZip":"","_VenuePhone":"","_VenueURL":"","_VenueStateProvince":"","_VenueLat":"","_VenueLng":""},"categories":[20],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dti.gov.ph\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3991"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dti.gov.ph\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dti.gov.ph\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dti.gov.ph\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/24"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dti.gov.ph\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3991"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.dti.gov.ph\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3991\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dti.gov.ph\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3991"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dti.gov.ph\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3991"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dti.gov.ph\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3991"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":3965,"date":"2019-07-22T05:49:50","date_gmt":"2019-07-22T05:49:50","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/www2.dti.gov.ph\/special-economic-zones-help-lure-investments-boost-exports\/"},"modified":"2020-01-27T09:06:57","modified_gmt":"2020-01-27T01:06:57","slug":"special-economic-zones-help-lure-investments-boost-exports","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.dti.gov.ph\/negosyo\/exports\/emb-news\/special-economic-zones-help-lure-investments-boost-exports\/","title":{"rendered":"Special economic zones help lure investments, boost exports"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>22 July 2019<\/p>\n<p>Published also in <a href=\"https:\/\/businessmirror.com.ph\/2019\/07\/20\/special-economic-zones-help-lure-investments-boost-exports\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Business Mirror<\/a><\/p>\n<p>AS countries attract foreign direct investment (FDI) to special economic zones (SEZs), active support to promote clusters and linkages is key to maximizing development impact, according to a United Nations report.<\/p>\n<p>United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\u2019s (UNCTAD) World Investment Report 2019 pointed out that firms operating in zones have greater scope to collaborate, pool resources and share facilities especially in specialized zones.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026But multi-activity zones can extract some of the benefits of colocation. Proactive identification of opportunities, matching efforts and training programs, with firms within and outside the zone, significantly boosts the impact,\u201d the report said.<\/p>\n<p>The report identified the Philippines as among the countries with the highest numbers of SEZs, along with India, the United States, the Russian Federation, Turkey, Thailand, the Dominican Republic, Kenya and Nicaragua. China alone hosts over half of all SEZs in the world in Asia.<\/p>\n<p>SEZs are credited with more than 60 percent of the Philippines\u2019s\u00a0 exports. This, as zone programs in many countries account for a major share of exports, particularly manufactured exports.<\/p>\n<p>The report also cited early research on the Philippines indicating that the share of FDI flows going to SEZs increased from 30 percent in 1997 to over 81 percent in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSEZs can make important contributions to growth and development.
